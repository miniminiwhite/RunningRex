# RunningRex

Base on a game framework by [James Cho](http://jamescho7.com/), I develop a game on Android which actually originates from Google's browser, Chome.

Tips on operation:</br>
During playing the game:</br>
Swipe upward to make the Rex jump(when running normally) or raise its head(when running with its body bending) .
Swipe downward to make the Rex bend its body(when running on the ground)

Have fun with this little app! :D
